# ESP8266-oximetry-and-heart-rate-sensor

A system that uses an ESP8266 and MAX30100 integrated pulse oximetry and heart-rate sensor.

It combines two LEDs, a photodetector, optimized optics and low-noise analog signal processing to detect pulse oximetry
and heart-rate signals.

The result is a display on an ILI9341 TFT of the users blood oxygen levels and pulse rate.

Currrently only the ESP8266 operates with the MAX 3010 library.
